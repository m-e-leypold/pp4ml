* About 'pp4ml'

'pp4ml' is a m4 based preprocessor for OCaml that extends the syntax
by 3 constructs to allow 'easy' embedding of tests in modules:

- let TEST(...) = begin ... end defines a test.
- Macros Expect() and Expect_raises() that assert certain
  conditions (bool or raising of an exception).

Example:

#+begin_src ocaml

  let TEST(foo) = begin
      
      let five = 5 in
      let doubletwo = 2*2 in

      Expect( Int.( four = doubletwo ))

    end;;


  let TEST(bar) = begin

      let four = 4 in
      let doubletwo = 2*2 in
      
      Expect( Int.( four = doubletwo ))
  end;;
  
#+end_src

Running a program with those tests embedded will result in outout like the following:

#+begin_example 

  => 2 tests to be run.

  Testing: foo ... 
  p3.ml:8: *** Expectation failed: Int.( five = doubletwo ). ***
  FAILED: foo.

  Testing: bar ... OK.

  PASSED: bar (1 tests).
  FAILED: foo (1 tests).
  -------
  STATS : 1/2 => 50 % passed.

#+end_example

Note the nice printing of the location where the expectation failed.

Currently it does not provide:

- Possibility to turn of tests (tests are always executed after the
  the module body).
- Run tests selectively or extract a list of embedded tests.
- Hygienc namespace in Expect...() - the namespace is currently
  polluted by a redefined ':=' operator.

Most of that is planned for a future version. The currently pending
release (0.0.1) must be considered more of a feasability study than a
finished product.

* Installing 'pp4ml'

The following shell commands should build a tree ready to be packaged in subdirectory STAGE. 

: make
: make install

Note that we never install to =/usr/somewhere=, but always in =STAGE/=
except if you set the make variable DEST to the empty string (so,
don't: Installing by bypassing package management is not considered
state of the art today).
